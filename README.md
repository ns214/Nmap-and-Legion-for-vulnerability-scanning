<h1>Scanning for vulnerabilities with Nmap and Legion</h1>


<h2>Description and Summary</h2>
This project uses the Metasploitable3 VM to demonstrate a basic network scan using both Nmap and Legion. Both options provide the same information, but Legion's use of a GUI makes it more user friendly. <br />

Of the many vulnerabilities on this VM, a basic scan with Legion shows 2 that are very obvious:
- The dashboard for WAMP Server is accessible without the need for credentials and authentication.
- MySQL is running on port 3306, the username is root and no password is required for access.
 
<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Box</b> 
- <b>Nmap</b>
- <b>Legion</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux</b>
<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

Nmap scan against the target 192.168.56.113, the "-O" option enables operating system detection:  <br/>

Used Legion's default options to scan the same IP address: <br/>

The screenshots in Legion show the application running on that specific port. The WAMP Server dashboard can be seen without a need to login:  <br/>

Legion also runs some scripts that check for lack of/default passwords, and in this case it found that the login is "root" and there is no password:  <br/>
